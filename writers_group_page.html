    <p>
      A writers group is an informal gathering of writers who meet regularly to share their work, advice, and peer criticism. But more importantly, to provide support and encouragement for one another.<br><br></p>
    <p>
Studies have shown that members of writing groups truly feel that they have improved their writing, received valuable feedback, gained a sense of accountability and increased motivation.<br><br></p>
    <p>
There are different types of writers groups. Some are general (all genres), while some are for a specific genre (romance, mystery, poetry, ...). Some are open to all skill levels, from new writers to published authors, while some are closed to new writers. Each writer will need to find the group with the right atmosphere and dynamics that will help them achieve their writing goals.<br><br></p>
