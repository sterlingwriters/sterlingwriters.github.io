    <h1>Black Rose<br><font size="+2">(by Rosanne Hoagland)</font></h1>

    <font size="+3">

<i>
A black rose was held loosely,<br>
The fingers did not move, though,<br>
&emsp;  the thorns pricked the skin.<br>
Eyes stared wide, from a <br>
&emsp; long dark veil, <br>
His best piece of work, this<br>
&emsp;  real still life. <br>
<br>

She was a reluctant model,<br>
&emsp; but after much persuasion,<br>
Soon saw things his way, and<br>
&emsp; was happy to pose for him.<br>
Her fingers not moving,<br>
&emsp; Loosely holding a black rose. <br>
