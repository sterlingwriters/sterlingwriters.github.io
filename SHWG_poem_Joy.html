One day a flower in our garden<br>
Has its bud squeezed tight<br>
A child winding up for a tantrum<br>
Then the next day it has burst open<br>
Welcoming hummingbird and bee<br>
Did you see a “joy” today?<br><br>

Heading outside to my little deck<br>
I started walking down the three steps to the yard<br>
A gray brown bird landed on a branch next to me<br>
The small, plain, nothing special bird is looking at me<br>
It sings a beautiful five-note song and flies away<br>
Did you hear a “joy” today?<br><br>

The sky was a rich blue today<br>
Not a cloud in sight, quiet, peaceful<br>
A breeze carrying butterflies passes by<br>
Your gardens are there for you<br>
Flowers in bright colors, fruits and vegetables ripening<br>
Did you feel a “joy” today? <br><br>

The youngster fighting for the day not to end<br>
Anxious to start a million new days<br>
The oldster happy to have made it through the day<br>
Rests now, to have the energy for tomorrow<br>
Both add a story to their life, this day<br>
Did you have a “joyful” day?<br><br>

The moon spreads a wrinkled carpet across the water<br>
Rays of sun shoot through thick gray clouds<br>
Colors compete in “rises” and “sets” for our enjoyment<br>
Sunlight through the trees dapple the path we walk<br>
As the storm ends, raindrops trickle off the leaves<br>
Do you feel “joy” inside you?<br><br>

Your family is safe around you<br>
You look at your son, your daughter, with pride<br>
They are your future; you hold their past<br>
Together you move forward, as best you can<br>
There is hope and faith screaming in front of you<br>
Do you feel “joy” in your heart?<br><br>
