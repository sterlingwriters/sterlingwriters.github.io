    <h1>All Fall Down<br><font size="+2">(by Dave Gregory)</font></h1>
    <p> 
    <font size="+3">
<i>

The sun is paying a temporary visit<br>
I hold an urn, a box, a container<br>
The wind is brisk and chaotic<br>
I stand by the shore, by the rail, in the garden –<br>
<br>

These are the ashes, the remains<br>
Of a mother, a father, a sibling<br>
Or a child, a pet, a love<br>
And I must follow their wishes –<br>
<br>

I open the holder and tip it<br>
The dust to dust slides free<br>
Into the air that surrounds us<br>
It blows up rather than down –<br>
<br>

It hangs suspended for a moment<br>
We see their image, I swear<br>
Through tears, through memories, through laughter<br>
Then it is gone, forever –<br>
<br>

But it has surrounded us<br>
And will live in us<br>
Will be a part of the earth, the wind, the water<br>
And our hearts will dry our tears tomorrow.<br>
<br>
