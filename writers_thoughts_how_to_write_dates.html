    <h1>How To Write Dates Correctly in Sentences</h1>
    <h4>(By Robert Lee Brewer - April 21, 2023)</h4>
    <p>

&emsp;
Learn tips on how to write dates correctly in English, whether you're ending your sentences with the date or plopping them right into the middle, including a few examples. Plus, an explanation of "in" vs. "on" when writing out dates.
<br><br>

How to Write a Date at the End of a Sentence:
<br>

&emsp;<b>Correct:</b> Jaws was released in the United States on June 20, 1975.<br>
&emsp;<b>Incorrect:</b> Jaws was released in the United States on June 20 1975.
<br><br>

If we wanted to be more general, we'd do the same thing, except we'd remove the numeral for the day and the comma and space that follow it.
<br><br>

&emsp;<b>Correct:</b>  Jaws was released in the United States in June 1975.<br>
&emsp;<b>Incorrect:</b> Jaws was released in the United States in June, 1975.
<br><br>

<br>
How to Write a Date in the Middle of a Sentence:
<br><br>

If there is a numeral for the day, remember to offset your year with a comma before and after the year numeral.
<br><br>

&emsp;<b>Correct:</b> Jaws was released in the United States on June 20, 1975, and overseas in December 1975.<br>
&emsp;<b>Incorrect:</b> Jaws was released in the United States on June 20, 1975 and overseas in December 1975.
<br><br>

If there's not a numeral for the day (that is, just month and numeral for the year), then no extra commas are necessary.
<br><br>

&emsp;<b>Correct:</b> Jaws was released overseas in December 1975 and in the United States on June 20, 1975.<br>
&emsp;<b>Incorrect:</b> Jaws was released overseas in December 1975, and in the United States on June 20, 1975.
<br><br>

<br>
What's Happening With "In" vs. "On" When Writing Out Dates?
<br><br>
'In' is used when writing out general dates like months and years. 
<br>

&emsp;<b>Correct:</b>  Jaws was released overseas in December 1975.<br>
&emsp;<b>Incorrect:</b>  Jaws was released overseas on December 1975.
<br><br>

Meanwhile, 'on' is used when writing specific days, dates, and holidays.
<br>

&emsp;<b>Correct:</b> Jaws was released in the United States on June 20, 1975.<br>
&emsp;<b>Correct:</b>  Jaws was released in the United States on Friday.<br>
&emsp;<b>Incorrect:</b>  Jaws was released in the United States on June 1975.
