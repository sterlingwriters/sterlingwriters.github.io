    <h2>Back to Basics:  Story Setting</h2>
    <p>
&emsp;
<u>What is the setting of a story?</u><br>
The setting of a story is the time, duration (from beginning to end), and place an author chooses to write about. The place of a setting can be a real location or a fictional, made-up location. The time of a setting can be the past, present, or future. The setting of a story creates context and should provide interest for the reader. The setting can also affect the mood of the story. Do you want it to be fast-paced, like in a big city? Or, something more calm and serene, like a rural, sleepy town?
<br><br>

&emsp;
<u>Three basic types of settings:</u><br>
- Backdrop Setting (vague and simple)<br>
The backdrop setting is an element that helps the reader grasp all the information of a setting, even though it does not affect the storyline or plot. A backdrop setting is commonly vague and simple, allowing the reader to use their imagination for the setting details. This type of setting is usually found in folktales and simply sets the mood. 
<br><br>

- Temporal Setting (focus on the time of a setting)<br>
The temporal setting focuses the reader on the time of the story. The temporal setting is an important aspect of a story, as it describes the time or era in which the story takes place. The temporal setting is very general, as it is simply the general time and place where all the action unfolds in a story.
<br><br>

- Environmental Setting (focus on the place of a setting)<br>
The environmental setting includes details of the geographical location (such as water, mountains, desert, etc.), the cultural and social setting (school, church, community, etc.), and the climate or weather (desert, forest, storm, etc.).
<br><br>

&emsp;
<u>Describe the setting (but don't over-describe):</u><br>
Too many upfront descriptions may bore the reader. You don't have to include every single detail, just allow your reader to use their imagination and let them be involved in the story. And you don't need to describe the setting all at once. Some details can be added as the story evolves, or better yet, as part of an action scene.
<br><br>

&emsp;
<u>Use your character's senses:</u><br>
Have the reader experience the setting the way your character does. What do they see, or not see that should be there? What do they hear (that is important to the story)? Do they touch a door handle and experience an unexpected burn to their bare hand? Does your character experience the nauseating and putrid smell of burning flesh, which takes them back to the war years? Use their senses to describe, but don't over-describe.
