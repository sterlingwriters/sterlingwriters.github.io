Teardrops, teardrops, shedding waterfalls,<br>
Little voices, little voices, calling, calling,<br>
“Hear me, hear me, Mommy, Daddy, I’m afraid.”<br>
<br>

When I was a kid, we played Cowboys and Indians,<br>
When I was a child, we played cops and robbers,<br>
When I was a boy, we played war.<br>
<br>

Teardrops, teardrops, shedding waterfalls,<br>
Little voices crying, little voices crying,<br>
“Help me, help me, come and make it better.”<br>
<br>

My hat was black, my horse a Palomino,<br>
My “caps” would pop, my mouth said “bang,”<br>
I was always wounded in the shoulder.<br>
<br>

Teardrops, teardrops, shedding waterfalls,<br>
Little hands reaching, little hands reaching<br>
Good boys, good girls, they could be sleeping.<br>
<br>

When we got tired of playing one game,<br>
We moved on and played another,<br>
We played until Mom and Dad called us home.<br>
<br>

Teardrops, teardrops, shedding waterfalls,<br>
Little angels calling, little angels calling,<br>
“Come play with us, come play with us.”<br>
<br>

And they are going, laughing, one by one,<br>
To play and sing, always pint-sized,<br>
Never growing old, always growing wise.<br>
<br>

Leaving Moms and Dads, all of us,<br>
Cheeks stained, hearts empty,<br>
Spitting anger and frustration.<br>
<br>

Then praying, praying, wordless prayers<br>
Prayers from our hearts, our guts,<br>
Teardrops, teardrops, falling to the floor.<br>
<br>

Little angels singing, little angels singing,<br>
“Mommy, Daddy, think of me,<br>
It doesn’t hurt anymore.”<br>
