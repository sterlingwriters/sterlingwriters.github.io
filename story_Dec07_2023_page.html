&emsp;<b>Story 1 by Rich Colon</b><br><br>
<i>
&emsp;
Mark Farmer was in a rush as he drove to attend his class reunion. Of course, he would end up stuck behind a slowpoke since he was running late. His thoughts started drifting to the past, to Janet and their senior year. As Mark drove, he tried to focus on the road, but his falling tears were blurring his vision. In his mind, he could still see Janet, slowly and gently walking on the frozen pond toward the ice fishing hut.
<br><br>

&emsp;
The night of senior prom, their gang of friends planned to have a party at the fishing hut out on the ice. That was the original plan they all agreed upon. However, the park ranger stated that the ice was not fully frozen and that it was too dangerous. Everyone was told, or so it was thought. Mark had started partying earlier that day, and he forgot to pass along the information and did not realize what he had done until it was too late. Now he drove as fast as he could to get down to the lake. The image of Janet in the center of the pond, going beneath the ice, is burned into his memory; never to leave, no matter how hard he has tried. That is why this reunion trip is so important, and why he is in such a hurry.
<br><br>

&emsp;
Finally, he passes the slow-moving vehicle and heads down the cut-off road to the lake. Mark is still on time; this will be perfect. He parks at the edge of the frozen pond, shuts off the engine, takes a deep breath, and gets out of his car. He starts walking out on the ice toward the spot where the old fishing hut used to be. Mark keeps an eye on the time as he walks so that he can go under the ice at the exact time that Janet did. This reunion has been years overdue.

&emsp;<b>Story 2 by Dave Gregory</b><br><br>

&emsp;
High school class reunions, do you like them?  I hate them. It was sort of novel; I missed the 5th and helped plan the 10th, but it wears thin quickly.
<br><br>

&emsp;
I was not “the most likely to succeed,” I was not captain of the football team, and I was not a member of the most popular “clique” in school. Oh, the football captain was, and the brainy kid was, but I belonged to the Key Club.
<br><br>

&emsp;
I went a couple of times over the years, and somebody would ask, “Are you going?” and I would or wouldn’t. I did have a good time once five of us arrived at the event; “well-fortified” and I guess it showed – what the hell.
<br><br>

&emsp;
When the notice comes every five years, I sometimes forget to pass along the information.  I mean, I went to an agricultural college and have a nice little farm just outside of town.  It’s hard work, but I enjoy it, and I have a wife and kids, and it’s the life we like to live – I’m a farmer.
<br><br>

&emsp;
In high school, I had a few close friends, and dated a little. But I was a “turtle,” a slowpoke; I was shy – but it worked out – my wife, I knew from grammar school, but we didn’t marry until our late twenties. We were on a date after we had re-met as members of a mutual friend’s wedding party.  We were both still single, and she was the polar opposite of me, she was “bubbly,” full of fun, enjoying life.
<br><br>

&emsp;
God knows what she saw in me.
<br><br>

&emsp;
Finally, we were having a drink after a movie, and I was working up courage – and she said, “Are you trying to ask me to marry you?” – I said yes, but… and started to list my misgivings.
She shut me up with a kiss.
<br><br>

&emsp;
So, at these reunions, we’re both sort of lost sheep – we are happy, we have good kids, and life goes on. I remember one we went to; I call it the “smile and nod” reunion. We sat there at our table and heard about how many patents a fellow had for the company he worked for.  Then there was the woman who was on her third marriage in ten years, and things weren’t going too well with number three.
<br><br>

&emsp;
Another thing, sometimes you are included because they don’t remember – “Do you remember the time we…? It wasn’t me, fella; you barely talked to me in high school.
<br><br>

&emsp;
The few friends we have from that time are the lucky ones to have; they have always been a part of your life, and you hope they always will.
