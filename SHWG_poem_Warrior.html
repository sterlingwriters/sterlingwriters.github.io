Last day of nervous rushing pace,<br>
Quiet talk plays softly through the air<br>
Over jangled nerves<br>
<br>

The last warrior speaks with care.<br>
Relived the battles that were fought,<br>
Both won and lost, <br>
<br>

On tedious litanies of plans, and ways<br>
The means to win at all costs,<br>
No price is too great to be the victor.<br>
<br>
The warrior survivor battles have just begun. <br>
<br>
