    <h1>Writer's Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
&emsp; We can learn a great deal about the craft of writing, from fellow writers; both successful professionals as well as those who are struggling. And you might be surprised by their generosity and support, a sense of comradery. Yet, the act of writing is a lonely endeavor.<br>
<br>

&emsp; This page will share some of that hard-earned, but important knowledge that all writers should at least review to determine what may be of help to them and their specific and unique writing journey.
