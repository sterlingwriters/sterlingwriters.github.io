    <h1>30 Minute Stories</h1>
    <p> 
As with any worthwhile endeavor, the more you practice the better you will become. And this is especially true with writing. That is why our weekly writers group does a 30-minute writing exercise; to get those creative juices flowing, and to have fun.<br><br>

For the exercise, we use 4 random words or phrases as inspiration for writing a story.<br><br> 

Here on this page, we will present some of the works created during our weekly writing exercise. Keep in mind that the writers have only 30 minutes once they are given the 4 story prompts. While the stories may not be perfect, they are definitely creative, which is the goal. The more you write, the better you become at the craft.
