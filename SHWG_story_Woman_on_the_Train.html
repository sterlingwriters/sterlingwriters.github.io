  It all started with just a glance at the woman next to me on the subway, who was furiously writing in what appeared to be a journal. I could see that she had written, “I fear someone will discover the body soon …” The woman seemed nervous as she held a scarf that was stained with dark blotches that could be blood. At that moment, the train came to an abrupt halt, and clutching her journal, she ran off.
<br><br>

&emsp;
  Everything seemed to be happening so fast. Before I could think, I found myself chasing after her. Someone had to do something, so I decided that it would have to be me. Rushing through the thickening crowds of commuters, I tried to follow but eventually lost sight of her. Once I left the train station and was out onto the street, I thought for sure that she was gone. But then I spotted her, just as she was getting into a cab. She would surely get away unless I acted quickly. Yet, what could I do? The cab was already moving into traffic, and then she would be gone. That’s when I noticed a bike messenger standing next to me. Without a second thought, I pushed him off his bike, and while apologizing, I hopped on and raced after the cab. The messenger had gotten up quickly and was running after me, yelling something I could not hear. But I could not stop; I had to keep peddling and try not to lose sight of the cab.
<br><br>

&emsp;
  After a few blocks, my energy was starting to wane, and I thought that I might have to give up the chase. Just when I thought it was the end, I saw the cab pull over. The mysterious woman was dropped off at a coffee shop, where she quickly went inside.  Nearly out of breath, I welcomed the opportunity to stop for a moment. Rather than wait outside, I decided that it might be better to try and get a little closer. The shop was crowded, but I was able to maneuver myself next to her at the counter. When she opened her wallet, I saw her driver’s license, but I could not read any details. So, I bumped into her, knocking her wallet to the floor.
<br><br>

&emsp;
  As I picked up the wallet, I studied her name and address, probably for too long. She immediately grabbed the wallet, screamed at me, and ran out the door. People around me stared as I tried to make my way and follow her.
<br><br>

&emsp;
  She may have thought that she had lost me, but I saw her just as she dove into a bookstore across the street. I ran over and peered through the large windows. The shop seemed to be empty except for an elderly man sitting at an old, cluttered roll-top desk. Quietly, I entered and began browsing through the books. After slowly searching up and down every aisle, I finally asked the shopkeeper about the woman who had come in before me. Yet he claimed that I was his first customer all morning. Just then, I saw the curtains behind him move ever so slightly. I called him a liar, and I started walking toward the curtains. But he reached under the desk and said that if I didn’t leave, he would call the police or that he would take care of me himself. My bravado faded as I thought more and more about what he might be holding out of sight, so I quietly left. Once outside the bookstore, I started thinking about what to do next when, suddenly, I remembered about the wallet and her address. I saw her address, and I know where she lives.
<br><br>

&emsp;
  Waiting outside the mysterious woman’s apartment, I hid as best as I could because I wanted—no, I needed—the element of surprise. After all, if she was a murderer, I had no idea of her preferred method. But I was so caught up in my thoughts that she walked right by me and was already starting to open the door. This was my chance, and I had to take it, so I ran up behind her and shoved the door open. To my surprise and relief, there was a policeman inside the doorway, and another had silently arrived, and he was right behind me. Then, to my astonishment, the police arrested me, and I was dragged away in handcuffs!
<br><br>

&emsp;
  I later found out that the woman is actually a famous author and that her journal entries were just notes for a new murder mystery novel. The poor woman suffers from severe nose bleeds, which account for the bloody scarf. But I am not a stalker, I am not dangerous, and this is all a misunderstanding! The judge will realize that, won’t they?
