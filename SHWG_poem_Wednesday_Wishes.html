Mabel Anne had her Wednesday’s wishes<br>
They were the same as her Tuesday’s wishes<br>
Her Monday’s wishes, her last week’s wishes<br>
Her last month’s wishes and none came true.<br>
<br>

They were simple wishes, gentle wishes<br>
She wished the kids at school would not bully her<br>
Mable Anne had just two dresses<br>
Her shoes were brown hand-me-downs.<br>
<br>

The shoes were held together with tape and glue<br>
Her dresses clean, but well worn<br>
Mable Anne was quiet and that combination<br>
Made her ripe for teasing and ridicule.<br>
<br>

Home was far from a refuge or a safe haven<br>
Her father drank and drank and was always drunk<br>
He beat her mother when he was home<br>
And made Mabel Anne uncomfortable with his stares.<br>
<br>

Her mother worked two jobs to keep the family afloat<br>
She left some money visible and stashed the rest away<br>
Her father grabbed the money as if deserving<br>
Then he would start his eternal litany.<br>
<br>

Everything was unfair, his last boss, he had none now<br>
His parents, the government, God, all unfair<br>
Nobody understood him, especially his wife<br>
And after a short build-up he rewarded her.<br>
<br>

Well-practiced, he would strike fast<br>
Hit or kick where it wouldn’t show<br>
She did not resist, she protested some<br>
First and most important, she made sure Mabel Anne was safe.<br>
<br>

His energy spent; he would wander off<br>
Somewhere to collapse or out the door<br>
The garbled tirade would wind down<br>
He was still the victim, leaving others fallen in his path.<br>
<br>

You were an object of his scorn if he perceived<br>
You were smarter than him, had a job, made a suggestion<br>
Didn’t agree with him, if he remembered his point<br>
His family left to recover, forgive, exist near him.<br>
<br>

Mable Anne’s mom would not discuss it, or hear ill words about him<br>
She would use the kitchen counter to help her stand<br>
She would dab a cut lip or pause to survive a wave of pain<br>
She would tell her daughter it wasn’t his fault.<br>
<br>

Schoolwork was her escape, her solace<br>
Buried in homework, consumed by reading<br>
The world inside her head, was how she survived<br>
And yes, she still had an imagination functioning.<br>
<br>

She had no friends, no cousins, aunts, or uncles<br>
That is none that acknowledged the relationship<br>
Her grandparents, those surviving, disowned their children<br>
Hardened by the disappointment of their son or son-in-law.<br>
<br>

Her room was her cocoon, her sanctuary<br>
But she left little in the open, nothing showing<br>
Fearing some fatherly rage would pull posters from the walls<br>
Smash trinkets on a table or a shelf, leaving shards of memories vibrating.<br>
<br>

There was another place for Mable Anne<br>
Her mother brought her to church every Sunday, for years<br>
Even if she had to work, she would see that she got there<br>
Mable Anne’s church, her place to feel part of another world.<br>
<br>

From the beginning, she loved Sunday School, the stories, the peace<br>
Some of the same kids from school were there too<br>
But without their numbers and in these surroundings<br>
They left her alone and one or two even talked to her.<br>
<br>

She loved the building, full or empty<br>
It was a place of joy and celebration<br>
Or a place to hold sorrow and grief<br>
It was a community within a community.<br>
<br>

When she was young, she was able to listen<br>
As she grew older, she would understand more<br>
The Minister took little pieces of the Bible<br>
And made sure people understood its meaning.<br>
<br>

And there was the music, the glorious music<br>
Spilling out of the organ and the mouths of the choir<br>
She joined in with the rest of the congregation<br>
Singing the hymns of praise and adoration.<br>
<br>

As she got older, she would spend more time at the church<br>
During the summer she would help at the church office<br>
There was always a mailing to get out<br>
The Sextant would need help setting up chairs and tables.<br>
<br>

The Minister assured Mable Anne’s mom it was no problem<br>
She was very helpful and seemed comfortable here<br>
And that was certainly the truth, she ran errands<br>
She helped the Music Director organize the choir’s music.<br>
<br>

Her favorite thing to do was to go into the empty sanctuary<br>
There she would sit in her favorite spot<br>
She could see the old trees outside and the cross inside.<br>
Inside her head and inside her heart she grew.<br>
<br>

The more mature Mabel Anne, took her Wednesday’s wishes<br>
And then turned them into adult thoughts<br>
From there she was able to see what was important<br>
Those feelings turned into Mabel Anne’s prayers.<br>
<br>

One late afternoon she was alone, sitting peacefully in the sanctuary<br>
And something inside her stirred, moved<br>
Not physically, but it was a feeling, a strong feeling<br>
She parted her lips and a sound came from her.<br>
<br>

It was nothing she planned, not quite a song<br>
Soft at first, almost a moan, like her mother<br>
After she had been beaten by her father<br>
But there was no pain, it was all escaping.<br>
<br>

Still, it was musical, more than a tune<br>
Rather a sustained note that grew and gained resonance<br>
Then the note wandered and became fuller<br>
It reached out in the empty space and claimed it.<br>
<br>

Each breath pulled meaning from inside her<br>
It almost broke into tears with all its tales<br>
The walls echoed this growing sound<br>
The big voice from the quiet girl flew everywhere.<br>
<br>

The Sextant paused in the hallway; the Secretary listened<br>
She got up and moved to the office doorway<br>
The Music Director quietly entered from the practice room<br>
The Minister left his office and moved quickly inside.<br>
<br>

Mabel Anne felt everything inside her and let it out<br>
All the bullied tears, the anguish for her mother<br>
Her love of being here in the church<br>
All that a young girl loves and fears.<br>
<br>

Nobody had a stopwatch, but it continued<br>
Each new breath carried a new meaning<br>
The Sextant put his mop aside and knelt next to his bucket<br>
The Secretary was shaking tears from her soul.<br>
<br>

The Music Director could only wonder at the beauty<br>
There was no practical description, it was hypnotic<br>
The Minister moved a little farther into the sanctuary<br>
He sat in the nearest pew and prayed.<br>
<br>

It all peaked and then stopped<br>
Mable Anne was still, she sat back relieved<br>
Blessed with knowledge not taught in school<br>
This place would be her place.<br>
